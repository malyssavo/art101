	<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
		<p>Experimenting with basic JavaScript data types and variables.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> My biggest challenge was trying to get all the headers the same size
				and font. I was also experimenting with the photo placement.
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> The results would be this webpage that includes an image of my chosen
			  car,along with the script output that describes the make, model, color,
				year, and age.
