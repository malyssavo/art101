	<h1>Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web</h1>
		<p>Experimenting with DOM manipulation using JavaScript.</p>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> My biggest challenge today was to correctly execute task 2. The
			output was the most difficult and I still can't figure out how to do it.
			Although I didn't fully follow the directions, I was still able to output
			a change in html attribute and use elements.

  <h2>Results</h2>
		<p> The results of this webpage was the usual index layout as well as using
			elements,assigned variables, and script to change the source text.
    </p>

  <h2>Script</h2>
	
		<p id="p1">I love cats</p>

<script>
document.getElementById("p1").innerHTML = "I hate cats!";
</script>

<p>The paragraph above was changed by a script.</p>
