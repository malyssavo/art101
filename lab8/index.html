	<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
		<p>Experimenting with anonymous functions and callbacks using JavaScript.</p>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> My biggest challenge today was trying to print the output of the callbacks
      or console logs.
    </p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
		<p> The results of this webpage was to use anonymous functions and callbacks
      to display an array, its evenness, along with the squareroot in console.
      I also managed to print the output, but it doesn't display the way I
      wanted it to.
