	<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		<p>Learning to write functions that take user input.</p>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> My biggest challenge was trying to get all the headers the same size
				and font. I was also experimenting with the photo placement.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
		<p> The results would be this webpage that includes an image of my chosen
			  car,along with the script output that describes the make, model, color,
				year, and age.</p>
<div>
	<h2>Script Output</h2>
  <script src="js/lab7.js"></script>
</div>
