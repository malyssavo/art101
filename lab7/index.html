	<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		<p>Learning to write functions that take user input.</p>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> My biggest challenge today was figuring out how to add css
      style to my script output. I found that the solution was to tag content
      division.

  <h2>Results</h2>
		<p> The results of this webpage was to successfully use functions that work
      the window prompt and later assorting the letters of a name in alphabetical
      order.
